# Connie Coleman Jewlery Site

A website based on the [publify cms](https://github.com/publify/publify).

### Installing Locally (from the publify setup instructions)

To install Publify you need the following:

- CRuby (MRI) 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3
- Ruby on Rails 4.2.x
- A database engine, MySQL, PgSQL or SQLite3
- A compatible JavaScript installation for asset compilation. See [the execjs
  readme](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#readme) for details.
- ImageMagick (used by mini_magick).

1.  Clone the repo
2.  `cp database.yml.example database.yml`
3.  Edit database.yml to add your database name, login and password.
4.  Run:

```bash
$ bundle
$ rake db:setup db:migrate db:seed assets:precompile
$ rails server
```

You can now launch you browser and access 127.0.0.1:3000.

### Install Publify on Heroku

In order to install Publify on Heroku, youâ€™ll need to do some minor tweaks.

First of all, you need to setup Amazon S3 storage to be able to upload files on
your blog. Set Heroku config vars.

```yaml
heroku config:set provider=AWS
aws_access_key_id=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
aws_bucket=YOUR_AWS_BUCKET_NAME
```

To generate the Gemfile.lock, run:
```bash
HEROKU=true bundle install
```

Remove Gemfile.lock from .gitignore and commit it.

Add the HEROKU config variable to your Heroku instance:

```bash
heroku config:set HEROKU=true
```

Push the repository to Heroku.

When deploying for the first time, Heroku will automatically add a Database
plugin to your instance and links it to the application. After the first
deployment, don't forget to run the database migration and seed.

```bash
heroku run rake db:migrate db:seed
```

If application error has occurred after migration, you need to restart Heroku server.

```bash
heroku restart
```
